# Bank application #

This application **simulates ATM** (which is our GUI) for your bank account. In the app there are already some account predefined, thus you can: 

1.  **Insert your card number and pin number**. The app will connect to one already predefined accounts and this one will be used until you take your card out. 
2.  You can withdraw your money (which are already predefined) from the bank account. **You can do so in 2 ways**. Either you choose one of a given amounts of money. Or you can insert your own amount which you want to take out.
3.  Then app includes a lot of messages, one of them is the **info box**. 

Application is based on 2 exercises I have done during my 2. semester at the university. All of them are here, [on github](https://github.com/Johnmalc/Homeworks2), and one of them is this [one](https://github.com/Johnmalc/Homeworks2/tree/master/Aufgabe1) and another one is [here](https://github.com/Johnmalc/Homeworks2/tree/master/Aufgabe13). The main logic is taken from [here](https://github.com/Johnmalc/Homeworks2/tree/master/Aufgabe13) (not GUI/Vars/Main.java).

This is how the app look like (based only on the FXML design; subjected to change):
